# AndroidAttractionsList
An app that displays a list of attractions and restaurants. Clicking on an item will display the website in a fragment.

The project is split up into two applications, one that displays restuarants and one that displays Chicago attractions.
To run you must open the project in android studio or find the sdk in the build folder. For full functionality both apps must be installed
since a feature of it is to be able to switch between the apps and views.
